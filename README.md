# Amazon-sales-analysis-project
OBJECTIVE: 
This analysis helps to identify strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats in 
the sales process and product strategy. Specific objectives often include: 
• Evaluate Sales Performance: Analyze sales volume, revenue, and growth 
trends to understand overall performance and seasonal changes. 
• Identify Best-Selling and Underperforming Products: Recognize top
selling products and those with low performance to allocate resources 
effectively 
• Sales and Revenue Tracking: calculate total revenue, average order 
values, and analyze revenue distribution across different products or 
regions. 
• Geographic Distribution of Sales: provides geographic insights into 
where the orders are being shipped.

CONCLUSION 
• Amazon.in is the dominant sales channel, accounting for nearly all sales. 
This indicates strong customer preference and trust in Amazon’s platform. 
Efforts should focus on maintaining and enhancing the business’s 
presence on Amazon.in, leveraging its popularity to drive continued sales. 
• Expedited shipping is overwhelmingly preferred over standard options, 
indicating that customers value faster delivery and are willing to pay a 
premium for it. Prioritizing expedited shipping logistics and ensuring 
reliable, quick delivery will be crucial in maintaining customer 
satisfaction 
• Set and Kurta lead in revenue, underscoring their high customer demand 
and indicating that traditional clothing items are core products. Expanding 
offerings, increasing inventory, and promoting these categories will likely 
yield the best returns. 
• Amazon fulfillment, with a higher count than merchant fulfillment, 
indicates that customers trust Amazon’s logistics network, likely due to 
fast delivery and customer service assurances.
